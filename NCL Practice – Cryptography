Note: The 0x is used to indicate that the value is hexadecimal and should not be converted.
c2NyaWJibGU=

This text is encoded in base64. You can identify this by analyzing the range of characters used in the message and recognizing that it falls within the range for base64 (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and =). This text can be converted to ASCII by hand or by using an online tool such as Base64Decode or CyberChef.

This text is doubly encoded - first with base64 and then with binary. To revere the process, the message has to be converted from binary to ASCII, then base64 to ASCII. You can use the Binary Hex Converter followed by Base64Decode. Itâ€™s possible to combine these two steps using CyberChef.
